# REST API PEN TEST NOTES

Rest api's are in everywhere , like smart phones almost every app in the smart phones are using rest api etc...

## Vulnerable Rest Api Application VM

- [Vulnerable App Download drive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GUzmbb-Ide5V3A5NUsiJ5U7wk_l9keU4/view)
- credentials of virtual machine ---> **securestore:securestore**

## API Documtentetation

- [Api Documentation of rest api using on the VM](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V0111L38BfP4_JVSpkpqRirJhLkkTIOF/view?usp=sharing)

## Explorer Lab

- SecureStore - VirtualMachine with vulnerable APIs
- API Documentation
- Virtualbox/Vmware Workstation
- Firefox Browser
- Burp Suite Community or Pro Edition
- Linux Machine (Ubuntu, Kali, parrot etc...) with Docker Installed

Once the vulnerable machine is install access the http://192.168.254.1/v1/users.php?format=json&username=securestore&password=securestore  
(in my case : port forward 80 ---> 80 on virtualbox for vulnerable machine, then access it from kali on the vmware workstation )
